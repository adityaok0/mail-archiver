# HENNGE CHALLENGE REPORT

I have used the react.js library to create this mockup UI. It took nearly 6 hours of effort for me to create this. The Mission 2 was a little tricky and the idea I came up with was to show a popup dialog to show the contents of the email on clicking on that particular email. Material UI was another package I used for the popup. It greatly saved the development time.

I have used bootstrap 4 to create the responsive behavior required.

Since no color codes were provided, it was a small challenge to predict the colours and find a matching color to be used in the mockup.

The page flow is as follows:

1. Initially the page loads with the no results page.
2. User clicks on the search icon to transition to the page with results.
3. Click on any email to inspect the body of the email.
4. Resize the browser width to see the mobile version of the mockup.
